## Data Quality Decisions

- Standardized inconsistent state names (e.g., Uttar → Uttar Pradesh)
- Merged UT variants into single administrative unit
- Preserved rows with missing state/district by labeling as UNKNOWN
- Did not split multi-district rows to avoid data duplication
- Health analysis performed at STATE level

### Rationale

- State-level aggregation was chosen because disease counts were often reported across multiple districts in a single row.
- Splitting district-level data was avoided to prevent artificial inflation or duplication of case counts.
- Missing geographic information was preserved as UNKNOWN to maintain data completeness and transparency.
- Cleaning focused on analytical usability while retaining raw data integrity for auditability.
